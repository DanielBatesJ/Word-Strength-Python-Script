This script reads a text document stored in a file, and based off a list of words to ignore, counts how 
many times each word occurs in the file, prints out results.

Setup:
	File Path: At the start of 'main.py', there is a variable called 'path', change string in the quotes to the location of the string you want to test.
	Number of printed results: The variable 'maxNum' is initilized to '5', change this value to the number of results you want printed.
	Words ignored by the script: The dictionary 'boringWords' contains indexes of all words the script will ignore. Add or remove words any words
		you want, any words in this dictionary will not appear in your results.


TODO: GUI to allow users to change parameters easier, create an executable.
